# DM Insights

* * *

Hello, my name is Drew and I am a forever DM for two different D&D 5E groups. I tend to write about my opinions on the system as a whole, as well as insights into my growth as a DM, in the hopes that it will aid you as a reader to one day DM a session or campaign of your own.

Additionally, this website is used as a source for all the homebrew world building I do, giving ideas that can be used (with a credit of course) by anyone who stumbles across them
