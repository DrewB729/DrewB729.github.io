# Retreat

* * *

## Introduction
A goblin army struck badly by a fireball, a dragon wounded grievously by the paladin's smites, a demon lord trapped in their home in the abyss. Sometimes, despite the urge to pummel into your players, you want your wonderful boss to escape and flee so that they can live another day. When the battle turns against your enemies, when do they get out and how best do they escape the chase of your players?

### When should enemies retreat?
Usually you want your players to be able to defeat their enemies in the fight, though not without some challenge along the way. But the enemies they fight are often not beasts with an intelligence of 3 and will often activate self-preservation and attempt to escape. If there is a large group of enemies, or they are a scouting party, the cowardly enemies might scoot away during the midst of combat and start fleeing. If the enemy is a large boss, they might have an escape plan to enact to allow a quick escape. Either way, most enemies will generally try and retreat if the party have done a significant amount of their HP or they see a large amount of their allies die. Keep in mind that if there is no escape as an option, then often enemies will go down in a blaze of glory and take some players with them, or maybe they will beg their way out, left to the mercy of the party.

### How do they get away?
A basic goblin or low cr enemy will probably have few options to run away, usually just a dead sprint. However if there is a lair an enemy may have prepared routes to escape, giving the option of collapsable tunnels or hidden traps that only they know about. Higher levels enemies will often have spells that they can cast, giving them the options of teleportation spells like *dimension door*, *mistystep* or *teleport*. While varying in distance, if they can escape the room they are in, the enemy will often have a good chance of getting away. Moreover, getting away is a lot easier if there is a distraction. Spells like *fog cloud* or *darkness* can obscure vision and give a chance to flee. Other spells like *fireball* or *meteor swarm* can injure or down enough party members so that the players are distracted enough on healing for the enemy to get away.

### Chases.
Sometimes, the bloodlust gets the better of the players and they wish to persue the enemies that are retreating. Often this situation will depend on the style of retreat. They are often capable of catching enemies in open areas or when their speed is the same or greater than the enemies. However, there is often little chance of a dragon flying at 150ft per round being caught by the party unless great efforts are taken. Usually I would recommend that if they would like to chase the enemy they can, but make sure that you make them aware of how far away enemies are getting so as to not waste time.
