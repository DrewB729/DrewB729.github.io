# Combat Danger
* * *
Whether it's a small group of goblins at level 2, an adult dragon at level 10 or Tiamat, The Chromatic Queen at level 20, fighting enemies is an integral part to a large amount of games of D&D 5e. But a group of 5 goblins at level 5 is not going to be as enjoyable as when they were fought at level 2. So how do you keep combat interesting throughout your campaign or at different levels of play?

One of the first things I saw when preparing to DM was a video explaining the necessecity of character deaths, and within the video it was explained that a combat is not fun when the players are obliterating the monsters. If there is not an element of danger within combat, or the risk that a PC may die, then what was the point in running the combat in the first place. Being on of my first lessons in DMing, this advice has stuck with me throughout my games, but it does come with it's own nuances and obstacles to work around.

Firstly, if every combat is a deadly encounter as described or calculated by the CR mechanics (DMG, pg 82) then a certain element of the fun is taken away. A deadly encounter should occur every now and again to keep your players on their toes, but danger and character death can also be achieved by a combination of easy, medium or hard encounters spread throughout an adventuring day. The party can use a few short rests, but most spellcasters won't regain spells and there's only so many hit dice that can be used, so resource management will become a key part of the adventure for them, making future encounters that tad more difficult. 

Secondly, don't feel like combat has to be extremely dangerous to be fun. You can incorporate monsters into different scenarios and environments to up the enjoyment level. For example, say the party need to retrieve a treasure or artefact from a difficult location like on a cliff or in the deep ocean, or they are in puzzle room and are trying to solve a difficult puzzle. These scenarios are somewhat diffcult in their own right and require different skill checks and challenges to be passed in order to get them. But imagine the party are trying to traverse a shattered staircase around a cylindrical room, requiring a series of tough athletics or acrobatics checks to be performed, as well as some buttons on the bottom floor being pressed to extend the slabs to stand on. Anyone can press a button, but what if the button pressers were being harrassed by the minions that guard the treasure at the top.
