# Critical Damage

* * *

## Introduction
Critical hits are often some of the most celebrated parts of D&D, watching the table erupt as a player rolls that crucial natural 20 against the boss. Dice are collected in their
multitudes to be able to figure out exactly how **much** damage is being dealt in this one strike. But how do you calculate your critical damage? I'll lay out the various ways I've seen
used to make up the dice rolls and modifiers and explaining my thoughts and opinions on them.

### Double the Dice
In the Player's Handbook on page 196, it is stated that, upon a critical hit being scored against an opponent, you roll double the amount of dice that you would have rolled normally. Taking a level 3 rogue as an example character, scoring a critical hit with a dagger having had advantage on the strike and thus gaining sneak attack damage on the roll, the total damage will amount to 2d4 from the dagger, 4d6 from sneak attack and then the usual modifiers (proficiency bonus and str/dex modifier).
