# Critical Damage

* * *

## Introduction
Critical hits are often some of the most celebrated parts of D&D, watching the table erupt as a player rolls that crucial natural 20 against the boss. Dice are collected in their
multitudes to be able to figure out exactly how **much** damage is being dealt in this one strike. But how do you calculate your critical damage? I'll lay out the various ways I've seen
used to make up the dice rolls and modifiers and explaining my thoughts and opinions on them.

### Double the amount of dice
In the Player's Handbook on page 196, it is stated that, upon a critical hit being scored against an opponent, you roll double the amount of dice that you would have rolled normally. Taking a level 3 rogue as an example character, scoring a critical hit with a dagger having had advantage on the strike and thus gaining sneak attack damage on the roll, the total damage will amount to 2d4 from the dagger, 4d6 from sneak attack and then the usual modifiers (proficiency bonus and str/dex modifier).

If there's one thing D&D players love, it's rolling dice. This method of criticals allows the players to have the satisfaction of rolling a large amount of dice and experience the joy
of them all clattering across the table or dice box. However, the downsides of this method is two-fold. Firstly, more dice = more maths. Players that struggle with the addition of dice in large quantities will likely take longer to calculate this amount. Secondly, from a mechanical standpoint, there is a chance that this amount doesn't add up to more than a normal attack's worth of damage. Whilst this chance is small, rolling 2d12 for a critical hit from a greataxe and rolling a 3 and a 4 does not carry the same joy as those shiny double twelves that every fighter dreams of.

### Double the value from the dice
Another adaption of calculating critical damage is doubling the amount you get from a normal roll of the dice. Taking the example from above, the rogue would roll their 1d4 and 2d6 and then double the total (for example, a 3 on the d4 and a 4+5 on the 2d6 would give a total of 12 damage, which would then be doubled to 24) before then adding the remainder of modifiers.
