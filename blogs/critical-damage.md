# Critical Damage

* * *

## Introduction
Critical hits are often some of the most celebrated parts of D&D, being able to watch the table erupt as a player rolls that crucial natural 20 against the boss is a joyous experience for all involved. Dice are collected in their multitudes to be able to figure out exactly how **much** damage is being dealt in this one strike. But how do you calculate your critical damage? I'll lay out the various ways I've seen used to make up the dice rolls and modifiers and explain the advantages, disadvantages and my own thoughts on them.

### Double the amount of dice
In the Player's Handbook on page 196, it is stated that, upon a critical hit being scored against an opponent, you roll double the amount of dice that you would have rolled normally. Taking a level 3 rogue as an example character, scoring a critical hit with a dagger having had advantage on the strike and thus gaining sneak attack damage on the roll, the total damage will amount to 2d4 from the dagger, 4d6 from sneak attack and then the usual modifiers (proficiency bonus and str/dex modifier).

If there's one thing D&D players love, it's rolling dice. This method of criticals allows the players to have the satisfaction of rolling a large amount of dice and experience the joy of them all clattering across the table or dice box. However, the downsides of this method are two-fold. Firstly, more dice = more maths. Players that struggle with the addition of dice in large quantities will likely take longer to calculate this amount which could put a damper on the moment. Secondly, from a mechanical standpoint, there is a chance that this amount doesn't add up to more than a normal attack's worth of damage. Whilst this chance is small, rolling 2d12 for a critical hit from a greataxe and seeing a 3 and a 4 does not carry the same joy as those shiny double twelves that every fighter dreams of.

### Double the value from the dice
Another adaption of calculating critical damage is doubling the amount you get from a normal roll of the dice. Taking the example from above, the rogue would roll their 1d4 and 2d6 and then double the total (for example, a 3 on the d4 and a 4 + 5 on the 2d6 would give a total of 12 damage, which would then be doubled to 24) before then adding the remainder of modifiers.

This method is perfect for larger numbers of players on a table. There isn't any extra rolling so the total calculations are less than before, with the satisfaction of that larger final total of damage. Yet when the damage is calculated there is still the chance that you roll the unfortunate 1 on the d12 and have your very much below average damage of 2 + modifiers for a normal hit, let alone a critical.

### Max the roll and roll once more
The final way I am going to write about removes the key problem from both the above ways. Take your normal damage roll, work out the maximum total you could get and then roll those same dice again, adding that to the maximum as well as the usual modifiers. Using the example again, the rogue would add 4 + 6 + 6 for their 1d4 and 2d6, then roll those dice again and add modifiers.

By using this method, it is only possible to roll above your normal damage range. This way you experience the resounding *crack* as that ogre receives the full brunt of a quaterstaff to the temple through the huge final total damage. But the problem of maths is still there, as calculating the maximum is roughly the same maths as doubling the amount of dice, just with a bit more multiplication and adding of large numbers.

## Conclusion
At my own tables, we use the final way of maximising the normal roll as it allows players to not have the sinking feeling of a normal damage from a critical roll. However, each of these ways does have their own individual merits to them and all are absolutely valid for use. For me, the key point is that a table should be consistent with how they are calculating these amounts, as an inconsistency could mean the dm is destroying players with critical hits whilst they are tickling the monsters with their own, or vice versa. If everyone is on the same page with how to calculate these, there are less questions of "what do I do now?" when a 20 is rolled, and the focus is wholly on the joy of the critical.
