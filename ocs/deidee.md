## Backstory:
Born and raised in __ Deidee's parents were both clerics of the Raven Queen working within __ . They held weekly sermons to the Raven Queen for the general public as well as performing the funeral rights for all residents that died within the city. One year, when Deidee was 18, a great plague swept through her town, wiping out the entire population apart from her, seemingly blessed by the Lady of Death herself in order to ensure the safe passage of all the residents in the city. While the plague died out, most travellers avoided the small village as it was away from most main routes and was an inconsequential village before the plague. Now a ghost town believed to be haunted by the spirits of those that died in the plague, Deidee was left alone for 40 years until she received an omen of great change from the Raven Queen. Leaving the town for good, she now travels trying to find whatever her mistriss is hinting towards.
