## Backstory:
Born to a celestial mother in one of the celestial planes, Zariel grew up fatherless but in a peaceful and pleasant home. Raised by their mother alone, Zariel achieved a good education and was allowed to let their sorcerous talents blossom, manifesting itself in both gold and black colour magics. Ostracised slightly for their unusual void eye, Zariel had no friends to spend their past time with. Determined to find out more about their father (since their mother would not tell them about him), Zariel set out on a mission to the  material plane, aiding mortals as they went about their search.
