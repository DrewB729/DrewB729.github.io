# Ankorra
Ankorra is my first homebrew world, made for a campaign of 4 players and primarily set in the continent of Rangroth, although there are 8 continents and a few more island nations that belong within the world.

Continents:

* [Ashdale](./ashdale.html)
* [Boropa](./boropa.html)
* [Kiria](./kiria.html)
* [Morket](./morket.html)
* [Rangroth](./rangroth.html)
* [Targoda](./targoda.html)
* [Winter's Veil](./winters-veil.html)
* [Zardia](./zardia.html)

Other nations:
